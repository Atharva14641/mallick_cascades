# mallick_cascades

This repository contains minified versions of all OpenCV Haar and LBP cascades. Minification has been achieved by removing unnecessary white spaces and unnecessary precision. 

The original cascades are also shared for reference. The minified cascades are named with a prefix *mallick_*
